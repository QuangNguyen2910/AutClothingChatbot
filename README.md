# Chatbot for Clothing Store

This repository contains the source code for a chatbot developed to serve as a clothing advisor and website guide for a clothing store. The chatbot is built using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) and leverages the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to retrieve information from a knowledge base stored in a text file.

## Features

- Provides clothing advice and recommendations to customers.
- Guides users on how to navigate the store's website.
- Uses advanced language processing capabilities to understand and respond to user queries.

## Installation

To deploy the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main script to start the chatbot:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

## Usage

Once the chatbot is running, users can interact with it by typing their queries or requests into the chat interface. The chatbot will then provide responses based on the information stored in its knowledge base.
